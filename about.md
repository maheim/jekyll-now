Hello! I studied [Computer Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering) at Northeastern University in Boston from 2016 to 2020. Currently, I am starting full-time work on design verification.

I am interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, the IoT, and robotics.
