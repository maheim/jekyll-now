I am an incoming Junior at Northeastern University studying [Computer Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering). This site will be an attempt to document a range of topics, including my varied interests, projects, thoughts, and hobbies. The audience is meant merely for myself (notes), or perhaps to explain to someone not familiar with me what I do/think. 

To-add list for this site:
* better about page
* Messing with page style until it looks good enough
* Make a blog post
* List out all interests and links where I go to find knowledge for each topic
* List out lifestyle habits - the good and bad and where we're going from here
* Rocket League videos/gifs because it's fun
* Old Minecraft builds

### Contact me
I'm likely to answer any question or opinion as long as it's framed positively. Feel free to reach out!
